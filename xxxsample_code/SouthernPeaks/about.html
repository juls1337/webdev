       <h2>About Us</h2>
       <p>
            Southern Peaks is a group of mountaineering enthusiasts based in the south-west of Ireland who meet up for climbing trips throughout the year but primarily during the summer months. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of accommodation 
            and travel, and to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy climbing buddy.
       </p>
       <p>
             Although we’re based in the south-west, we don’t confine ourselves to our own patch: past climbing weekends have included
              trips to Ben Nevis in Scotland and Snowdon in Wales.
       </p>
        <p>
              When we’re not climbing, we often meet up in a local pub to 
              talk about our recent adventures and plan future trips.
